### 🛡️ Mission

Soorma (meaning "Warrior" or "Brave") is being built to solve the fragmentation in the AI Agent ecosystem. We are building the control plane for the next generation of agentic applications.

We believe the future of AI infrastructure must be:

- **Open Source**: The core runtime will always be MIT licensed.
- **Self-Hostable**: You should own your data and your agent's reasoning logs.
- **Model Agnostic**: Orchestrate agents across OpenAI, Anthropic, Mistral, or local Llama instances.

### 🚧 Roadmap Status

We are currently in Pre-Launch. The core platform is being built in private to ensure a stable, type-safe, and secure initial release.

| Phase | Status | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Phase 0 | 🟡 Active | Core Architecture, Identity, Memory, and Agent SDK. |
| Phase 1 | ⚪ Planned | Public Release of soorma-core. |
| Phase 2 | ⚪ Planned | Managed Cloud Beta & Enterprise Connectors. |
